These are my solutions for the problems assigned in the [Harvard 2024 CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/).

I wrote them entirely on my own, and I do not guarantee they are the optimal ones; nonetheless, they work and all of them surpassed all the test cases. If you are taking the course, please remember to observe the course [policy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/#policy), so do not use them as if they were written by you, but use them instead as a mean of comparison after you have submitted your own solutions.
